/*
Given a blacklist B containing unique integers from [0, N), write a function to return a uniform random integer from [0, N) which is NOT in B.

Optimize it such that it minimizes the call to systemâ€™s Math.random().

Note:

1 <= N <= 1000000000
0 <= B.length < min(100000, N)
[0, N) does NOT include N. See interval notation.
Example 1:

Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[1,[]],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[2,[]],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,1,1,1]
Example 3:

Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[3,[1]],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,0,2]
Example 4:

Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[4,[2]],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,1,3,1]
Explanation of Input Syntax:

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has two arguments, N and the blacklist B. pick has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.
